Introduction:

Welcome to the GitHub repository for our Network Vulnerability Scanner powered by Reinforcement Learning! In an increasingly interconnected world, the security of computer networks is of paramount importance. This project explores the intersection of cybersecurity and artificial intelligence, aiming to create a robust and adaptable solution for identifying vulnerabilities in networked systems.

Project Overview:

Network Vulnerability Scanner is a critical tool for cybersecurity professionals and penetration testers, helping them discover weaknesses and potential entry points in a network. Traditionally, these scanners rely on predefined signatures and heuristics to identify vulnerabilities. However, in the ever-evolving landscape of cyber threats, a more intelligent approach is needed.

Our project leverages Reinforcement Learning (RL), a subfield of artificial intelligence, to develop a Network Vulnerability Scanner that learns and adapts over time. By using RL techniques such as Q-learning, the scanner can make informed decisions about which network ports to scan and identify potential vulnerabilities based on historical data.

Key Features:

Reinforcement Learning: Our scanner employs Q-learning, a model-free RL algorithm, to optimize the scanning process. It learns from previous scans and improves its scanning strategy over time.

Dynamic Vulnerability Database: The scanner is equipped with a dynamic vulnerability database that is constantly updated with the latest threat intelligence, ensuring accurate identification of vulnerabilities.

Customizable: Network administrators and penetration testers can easily customize the scanner's behavior by adjusting hyperparameters, allowing it to adapt to different network environments.

Efficiency: Unlike traditional scanners that scan all ports, our RL-based scanner intelligently selects ports to scan, reducing scan time and network load.

Getting Started:

To get started with our Network Vulnerability Scanner, please refer to the documentation and installation instructions in this repository. You'll find detailed guides on setting up and configuring the scanner to suit your specific needs.
